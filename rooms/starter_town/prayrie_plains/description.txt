You are on a dirt path on the prayrie_plains.

It's such a beautiful day. The greenery is vibrant, basking in the warm rays that the sun has blessed.

This will be easy! Piece of cake! Look out world, here I come!

There's starter_town at one end and the gated entrance to the maize_forest at the opposite end.

You can see a man at the the gated entrance to maize_forest, maybe you should talk to him?
