You are at the entrance to maize_forest.

You had forgotten that maize_forest, name after the nomadic corn farmers who planted the entire area before they left, is a maze from which few return. A dense fog rolls in as you approach. You can feel your spirit sink into your boots.

You can enter, or you can leave.
