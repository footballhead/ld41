You are in gross_swamp.

gross_swamp is named after General Gross, who led an army of 45 brave men that all drowned here on their way to battle. The kign was not happy that day. The event is celebrated every November 22nd.

You can see the forest behind you and Nelly's castle in the distance. It's covered in rain clouds producing loud rumble of thunder and brilliant flashes of lightning. Ya know, typical stuff.
