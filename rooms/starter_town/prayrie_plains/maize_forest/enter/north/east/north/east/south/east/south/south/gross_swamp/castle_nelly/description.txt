You enter the unguarded castle.

You find that odd, but realized you have to go through a maze and a swamp to get here so maybe you weren't supposed to get this far?

Either way, as you snoop around, here finally hear noise coming from, what appears to be, nelly_study. Or you can leave the way you came.
