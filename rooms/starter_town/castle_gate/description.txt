You are standing in front of the drawbridge of the main castle_gate.

The guards stand at-the-ready but are visibly shaken, much like the townsfolk. You try to get more information from them, but they say nothing. They just look at you with quivering eyes.

That ain't gonna stop you from seeing the king though, so, upon persuation, the guards lower the gate, revealing the way to the throne_room.
